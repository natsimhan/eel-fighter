# Eel Fighter

A horizontal scrolling shooter game where you control an electric eel battling
through waves of enemy fish.

It is a mini-game to learn how to code a game from A to Z with
Phaser; it is a demonstration whose initial architecture is provided by a Phaser
template.

This is created from a Phaser 3 project template that uses Vite for bundling. It
supports hot-reloading for quick development workflow, includes TypeScript
support and scripts to generate production-ready builds.

**[This Template is also available as a JavaScript version.](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-vite)**

- [Phaser 3.80.1](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)
